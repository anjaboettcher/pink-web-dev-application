        <h5>I enjoy the format</h5>
        <p>In 2017 I started working for Malmö based health-tech company Min Doktor. I picked up web development as a hobby as I was inspired by my
          colleagues working as developers transforming an industry.
          <p>That
            journey led me to do a 9-week long web dev bootcamp with Ironhack during the summer of 2019. I really
            enjoyed
            learning on site in a community context with a set curriculum together with like-minded people.</p>

        <h5>I want to keep on learning despite becoming a mum</h5>
        <p>In April 2020 me and my partner are expected to become parents for the very first time which is super exciting.
          I want to use my parental leave to become an even better developer and go deeper into some topics
          which
          we brushed through during the bootcamp. </p>
        <p>I think the pink web dev curriculum is really well rounded and
          comprehensive. I also enjoyed seeing some topics that are not included in the typical web dev curriculum. Some topics which I am particularly interested in delving deeper into are responsive web
          design,
          cross browser compatibility, SEO, AJAX and working more with APIs.</p>

        <h5>I want to contribute</h5>
        <p>As I already have some experience with web development I also hope to actively contribute
          to the course with my previous knowledge and resources and help other students where I can.</p>

    <h2 >My background</h2>
    <p>In other jobs I have worked with the Adobe suite both for photography and
      graphic design, which I feel has helped me a lot on my web developer journey so far. I really enjoy playing with
      fonts and colors and trying out different CSS frameworks. I have also developed a taste for logical coding problems for example by
      solving puzzles on Codewars.</p>
    <p>Through my work with support, I have helped a lot of users navigate through a
      service. Clear communication, patience and understanding that not everyone has the same technical literacy
      are key in that role. This has helped me to become a better communicator. I think this is a valuable skills as a developer because it is much more social
      than it used to be. Developers are also expected to manage people and expectations.</p>
    <p>Learning programming for me was quite a challenge, especially when I was first trying to learn it mostly on my own. It is hard to have 
    errors thrown at you all the time and can teach you quite a it about life. While doing the bootcamp, I wrote a <a class="underline"
        href="https://medium.com/@anjaverenaboettcher/what-programming-can-teach-you-about-failure-786d97853f2c"
        target="_blank">Medium article</a> on how programming teaches you to deal with failure. During this journey, I
      have learned how important it is to not wait too long but to talk to someone if you feel stuck.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <h2 class="blue-text">What I expect</h2>
    <p class="blue-text">I am hoping for a supportive and collaborative community. I am hoping become better at using established standards within web development. I also hope you can help us to
      overcome the point where we might feel “No, we can’t do this!”, which can easily happen as a junior developer.
      But maybe most important of all ...to have fun along the way! </p>
